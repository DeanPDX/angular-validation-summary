# Angular Validation Summary

A fast, customizable validation summary component for Angular 6/7.

## Getting Started
Coming soon!

# Development

The main app (`angular-validation-summary-srcs`) is for building and testing the `angular-validation-summary` library in the `projects` folder. I used [this story on creating a library](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/wiki/stories-create-library) as a starting point, and tried to take project structure cues from the [Angular Material 2 Project](https://github.com/angular/material2) where applicable.

## Design Goals

* It should be performant.
* It should work easily out of the box.
* It should be easy to customize.
* It should be well-documented and easy to modify.
